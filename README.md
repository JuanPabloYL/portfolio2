# 💼 Personal Portfolio – Juan Pablo Yagüe

This is my personal developer portfolio website built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. It showcases my skills, projects, and contact information. The purpose of this site is to provide potential clients, collaborators, or employers with a quick overview of who I am, what I’ve built, and how to reach me.
